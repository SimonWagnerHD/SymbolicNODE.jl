# SymbolicNODE.jl

This repository features tools to train ML models which combine symbolic regression with neural differential equations.

The notebook test/example.ipynb demonstrates the basic usage of the different modules.

An evaluation of the performance of different models can be found in test/analysis.ipynb.
